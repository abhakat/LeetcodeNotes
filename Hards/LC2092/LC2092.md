### 2092: Find All People with Secret

## What is this question about
idk tbh, kinda fun tho


## NC Solution:
Uses union find.

This is a lot more optimal.

Time Complexity:

Big(O(M))

```Python
class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        # m
        # n
        #O(mlogm + n)
        secrets = set([0, firstPerson])
        time_map = {} #time -> adj list meetings

        #sort based on time
        for src, dst, t in meetings: 
            if t not in time_map:
                time_map[t] = defaultdict(list)
            #edges are undirected
            time_map[t][src].append(dst)
            time_map[t][dst].append(src)
        
        #dfs will have access to the visit below so I don't have to pass it in
        def dfs(src, adj):
            if src in visit:
                return 
            visit.add(src)
            secrets.add(src)
            for nei in adj[src]:
                dfs(nei, adj)

        for t in sorted(time_map.keys()):
            visit = set()
            for src in time_map[t]:
                if src in secrets:
                    dfs(src, time_map[t])
        return list(secrets)

```

## Brute Force Solution (priority queue, my idea)

```Python
class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        from heapq import heappush, heappop
        h = []
        for p1, p2, t in meetings:
            heappush(h, (t, p1, p2))
        known = {0, firstPerson}
        current_time = None
        current_meetings = []
        
        while h:
            t, p1, p2 = heappop(h)
            if t != current_time:
                # Process all current meetings
                self.processMeetings(current_meetings, known)
                current_meetings = []
                current_time = t
            current_meetings.append((p1, p2))
        self.processMeetings(current_meetings, known)  # Process last gathered meetings

        return known

    def processMeetings(self, meetings, known):
        update = True
        while update:
            update = False
            for p1, p2 in meetings:
                if p1 in known and p2 not in known:
                    known.add(p2)
                    update = True
                elif p2 in known and p1 not in known:
                    known.add(p1)
                    update = True

```
