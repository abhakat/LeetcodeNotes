# P3: Advanced SQL: Subqueries

## Subqueries
* Runtime Error if there is no tuple or more than one tuple

```SQL
SELECT cafe
FROM Sells
WHERE drink = "Latte" AND
price = (SELECT price FROM SELLS WHERE cafe = "Cafe Benne" AND drink = "Mocha")
```

### Example:
* Ineer guery(price = ) will return the price for a mocha at cafe benee
* Then we find all cafes that sell lattes at that price.
  
## The IN Operator
* (tuple) in (relation) is true IFF value exists in set

```SQL
SELECT *
From Drinks b1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
            FROM Sells
            WHERE drink = b1.name AND price >= 4.99)
```
### Example: want to find name and manufacturer of drink that Fred likes

* b1 refers to outer relation, thus this is a correlation query
* Typically want to avoid these unless it is absolutely necessary

## The ANY Operator
* x = ANY(relation) means that x equals at least one tuple in the relation
* x is greater than or equal to at least one tuple in the relation
* basically: "does it match at least one"

## The ALL operator
* x = ALL (relation) means that for every tuple t in the relation, x != t
* i.e. "does it  match all of them
  ```SQL
SElECT drink   
FROM Sells
WHERE price >= ALL (
    SELECT price
    FROM Sells
);

  ```

### ADVANCED SQL: Set Operations

## Union, Intersection, Difference

* Must make sure both subqueries are union comperative!

```SQL
-- this is NOT union comparative
(SELECT name FROM Drink) UNION (SELECT drink FROM Sells)
-- THIS is Union Comparative
(SELECT name FROM Drink) UNIOn (SELECT drink as name FROM Sell)

```
