# Advanced SQL: Grouping and Aggregation

## Aggregations
* SUM
* AVE

```SQL
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM Sells
WHERE drink = "Mocha"
```

* COUNT
``` SQL
-- COUNT ALL
COUNT(*)
-- counts nnumber of tuples
-- but counts NULLS and duplicates

-- VS DISTINCT --
SELECT COUNT(DISCOUNT price)
FROM Sells
WHERE drink = "Mocha"
-- only counts unique prices 
-- excludes NULLs
```
* MIN 
* MAX

## Grouping
```SQL 
SELECT drink, AVG(price) --third averages dirnks grouped by price
FROM SELLS -- first
GROUP BY drink; -- second
```
