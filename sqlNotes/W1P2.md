# Presentation 2.1 & 2.2: SQL Joins

## SQL: Structured Query Language
* Separated into DDL (data Definition Language) and DML(Data Manipulation Language)
  
## Single Relational Query
* Input can take one or more table, output is always a SINGLE table
*  Accesses in order FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT
  
```SQL
SELECT Number, Owner
FROM Account
WHERE Type = "savings";
```
### Renaming Attributes
* Use the as keyword to rename attribute in a table
* this is useful to basically name groups or specific requetss
```SQL
SELECT Number AS Acc_Num, Owner
FROM Accounts
WHERE Type = "savings";
```
### Modify Using Arithmetic Expressions
```SQL
SELECT cafe, drink, price * 120 AS priceInYen
```
### Creating Temporary Tables
```SQL
SELECT Owner INTO temp3 
```

### Complex Conditions
```SQL
SELECT price
FROM Sells
WHERE cafe = "Caffe bene" AND drink = "Mocha";
```

## Patterns
* Where clauses can pattern-match
* % used for any string
* _ used for any char
```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Customers
WHERE phone LIKE '%555-_ _ _ _';
```

## Ordering
Results are not ordered, use ORDER BTY keyword to speciy this(ASC is default)
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM ACCOUNT
BY Balance DESC
```
*Ties are broken with the second attribute, in the ex provided: age
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM Account
ORDER BY Balance, age
```

## Multi-Relation Queries(JOINS)
* You can list multiple relations in one query to combine data from multiple relations
```SQL
SELECT A.Owner, A.Balance
FROM Account A, Deposit D
WHERE D.AcctNum = A.Number and A.Balance > 1000;
```
* Use relation attribute to distinguish attributes with the same name
* Correlation names are local vars which you can send when writing the query

##Cross Product
```SQL 
SELECT * 
FROM Department, Employee
```
This creates a huge table because of cross product so equivalent based join helps us be more specific:
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM Employee emp JOIN Department dept
    ON emp.DepartmentID = dept.DepartmentID
```
This example only outputs rows where department ID matches through natural join:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Employee emp NATURAL JOIN Department dept 
```
This is more concise because unlike equijoin it doesn't list both emp and dept ID which is redundddant because they are both the same

## NULL Values
###What are Null Values?
* Missing Value: if we don't possess a value yet it can be left as null
* Inapplicable: ex -> attribute for married ppl, not for unmarried

##Logical conditions in SQL
* Query only produces tuple if reducing value is 1
* True = 1, False = 0, Unknown = 0.5
* AND = MIN, OR = MAX, NOT(x) = 1-x

Ex: TRUE AND (FLSE OR NOT(UNKNOWN)) = MIN(1, MAX(0, (1 - .5))) -> simplify in this approach

## NULLS and JOINs
* left outer join: include left tuple even if there is no match
* right outer join: include right tuple even if there i no match
* full outer join: include both tuples even if there is no match

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM Employee emp LEFT OUTER JOIN Department dept
    ON emp.DepartmentID = dept.DepartmentID
```

This includes rows with matching dept ID< but ALSO includes rows that exist in the elft table but not the right table- pads with onexisting info using NULL in the resulting table
